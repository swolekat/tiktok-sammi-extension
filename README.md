# TikTok Sammi Extension

After discovering that streamerbot had a way to get tiktok data in, I wondered if you could do the same for sammi. This extension is a result of that thought experiment.

## Requirements
You MUST be running [Tikfinity](https://tikfinity.zerody.one/) locally. This runs a websocket server that the extension will use.

## TOS Warning
Tiktok does NOT have concrete rules around third party integrations. So please use at your own risk.

## Installation
Inside of SAMMI, on the left select bridge. Select install new extension. Install tiktok-sammi-extension.sef.

That's it. There's no deck, but you should see the extension from inside the bridge

## Usage
There are four triggers:
* TikTok Chat
* TikTok Gift
* TikTok Subscribe
* TikTok Like

You can use wildcards such as `TikTok Chat *test*` in your trigger for wildcard matching
